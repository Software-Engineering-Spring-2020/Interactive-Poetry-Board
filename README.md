# Interactive Poetry Board

## Overview
HDMI has created an Interactive Poetry Board that provides a fun and engaging way for visitors to create their own poems from crossword clues. The concept, poems, and clues were all created by Dr. Emily Carr.

The board allows the visitor to select from three crosswords and to print the resulting poem. Poems can be effortlessly added by a future team.

The board is deployed as a web application that can be run on almost any browser.
