Information needed for each Puzzle Object
Based on "Yesterdays' News Data.docx"

IDs are blank right now. Eventually, they will say something like "3d" for 3 down or "38a" for 38 across. Or do you guys think there's a better way of doing it?

I'm leaving the IDs blank right now. We might use the exact crossword she gave us, or use her data to re-generate one. (To reference the data she used, look at "Yesterdays' News Data.docx" document she sent in her "Dr. Carr's crossword poem stuff." I believe we can plug that document right into the website.
