BACKGROUND
Visual Arts Major
Moderate prior knowledge of program--teammember discussed wireframes with them
Spent ~15 minutes on the program

HOW THEY USED THE PROGRAM
> Started by entering name in poem section
> Read through the directions of all the sections
> Clicked intractable elements (ACROSS/DOWN, Poem Selection, A&C)
> Spent a long time reading the A&C, was interested in artistic vision
> Was confused by the Poem section--couldn't tell what it did initially
> Spent a while clicking/exploring clues
> DID NOT click Dr. Carr's website
POSITIVE COMMENTS
> Looks really good
> Buttons are fun to click, very tactile
> Likes the turquoise
> Thought the print screen was cute
> Thought the website overall was cute/fun
CRITICISMS
> Crossword text is hard to read: the black background is a lot and the text is very thin. The boxes the words are in are small. It's a combination of things.
> It would be nice for the words on the crossword to remain teal once they've been selected. It would distinguish them from ones that haven't been selected. Contrast between white and black makes it hard to read.
> Didn't notice the poem being built as they were clicking clues--it just looked like a title screen. "Maybe something teal" to make it stand out. And/or, maybe instead of a scroll down message at the top, we could put a line inside the poem like "look back here later to see a unique poem generated by the clues you click" and then get rid of the line when the user starts clicking clues.
> Would have liked for the "Enter name.." to be the same font as the rest of the website.
> Wondered why "Enter name.." only had two ellipses.
RELEVANT TO DR. CARR
> "The answers interact with the clues in really interesting ways."
> Why does the user-generated poem not include the words?
